- Iâ€™m interested in Space ðŸš€! I'm always looking to improve myself in all the related domains (which are quite numerous)! I'm especially interested in Space Exploration! 
- Iâ€™m currently learning to forecast some Space Weather penomena in what we call the Sun-Earth chain! I'm a PhD student at the UniversitÃ© Grenobles-Alpes working with two labs: the IPAG (Institut de PlanÃ©tologie et d'Astrophysique de Grenoble) and the Gipsa-Lab (Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique). I ended up mixing two topics that I love: astrophysics and artificial intelligence.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on applying data science to all space-related fields, including heliophysics, space medecine, Lunar exploration or even climate adaptation! In this context, I'm interested in attention mechanisms, physics-informed neural networks or Gaussian Processes.
